        "excerpt":"  The development of molecular sciences for materials, food and health critically depends on comprehensive and non-invasive specimen characterization. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most widely applied analytical methods and has found abundant application in biology, medicine and materials research.   To address these challenges, the four major Dutch centres for magnetic resonance research in structural biology, materials and metabolic mapping as well as imaging techniques, together with the public private partnership for analytical chemistry TI-COAST, formed in 2011 a national consortium. This concerted effort resulted in the implementation of a national ultrahigh-field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility (uNMR-NL) that aims at providing open access to a new generation of NMR instruments operating at ultra-high field strength across scientific disciplines and industrial research.   The central high-field 950 MHz spectrometer of the uNMR-NL facility is equipped with probes for liquid- &amp; solid-state NMR spectroscopy and microimaging   As a first step in this direction, the uNMR-NL consortium received funding to place at Utrecht University a 950 MHz standard bore equipped with several solution-, solid-state an micro-imaging probes that has been installed in the summer of 2015. This machine will in the near future be followed up by the first ultra-high field instrument, a 1.2 GHz standard bore NMR, in the Netherlands.  ","categories": ["news"],

        "excerpt":"     What is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and what can we do with it? This video, produced for the occasion of the official opening of the uNMR-NL research facility in the Netherlands, shows how, with NMR spectroscopy, we can determine the structure of molecules to help develop the materials, food and medicine of the future.   An NMR spectrometer works using the same principle as an MRI scanner in a hospital, in order to visualise the structure of molecules. Molecules are the foundation for life and for the materials that we as humans can make. In order to understand the role a specific protein plays in the development of cancer, or why a new nanomaterial displays certain properties, you have to understand the structure of the molecules.   The uNMR-NL research facility at Utrecht University was opened by State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands Sander Dekker on Thursday, 5 November, 2015. With its ultra-powerful 22 Tesla magnet, uNMR-NL is among the world’s leading NMR facilities, allowing researchers to study very large molecules for the first time, with an extremely high spectral resolution. The magnet can be used for chemical, biological, and materials science research. The uNMR-NL facility was set up by the universities of Utrecht, Eindhoven, Leiden, Nijmegen and Wageningen in cooperation with the public-private institute for analytical chemistry COAST and is part of the National Road Map programme for large-scale research facilities of the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research NWO.

More than 100 years later, in 1994, the American George Olah won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for understanding the mechanism behind this important reaction. This is also how it has been described in Chemistry textbooks for almost 30 years. However, recently some  chemists claimed the Nobel Prize winning reaction mechanism doesn’t always apply. Now, chemists at Utrecht University refute this claim. They managed to detect the two most important reaction intermediates from Olah’s reaction mechanism in the situation under debate. Olah, who passed away in March, has now received posthumous confirmation. The results of the study will be published online in Nature Catalysis on 20 November.

The Weingarth lab at Utrecht University discovered a new mechanism of how antibiotics kill bacteria. The antibiotic teixobactin uses a dual molecular strategy: it blocks the bacterial cell wall synthesis and destructs the cell membrane, the researchers write in the scientific journal Nature. The new insights could enable the design of powerful antibiotics against which bacteria do not readily develop resistance.   “Bacteria need a special lipid called lipid II to build their protective envelope around them. We show at atomic level that teixobactin targets and sequesters lipid II. Afterwards, teixobactin and lipid II together form long fibrils on bacterial cell membranes,” says Markus Weingarth. “Gradually, this creates a kind of valley in the landscape of the cell membrane, which then breaks down and damages the membrane.” The Utrecht researchers turned out to have found a biomolecular mechanism that was unknown to science until now. “It is a unique killing strategy.”   Read more   Publication:   Teixobactin kills bacteria by a two-pronged attack on the cell envelope  Rhythm Shukla, Francesca Lavore, Sourav Maity, Maik G.N.Derks, Chelsea R.

A team of researchers led by the group of Hugo van Ingen, discovered a novel mechanism by which nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, can be assembled. Nucleosomes are made by carefully controlled  process in which different histone proteins are deposited step-by-step on the DNA through different chaperone proteins.   The chaperone protein APLF can assemble the nucleosome single-handedly in one step, the researchers write in the scientif journal Science Advances. As the APLF protein is part of the DNA repair process, this unique mechanism could be means to maintain epigenetic information during DNA repair.   PhD student Ivan Corbeski in the van Ingen group used NMR and other experiment to discover that APLF can bind and assemble all four core histone proteins simultaneously,. Together with the Sixma group at the Netherlands Cancer Institute NKI the crystal structure of the APLF-histone complex could be solved, showing that APLF assembles the histones in their native fold as in the nucleosome.   The group of Francesca Mattiroli at teh Hubrecht Institute could then show that APLF can transfer the histones via this complex to the DNA to form nucleosomes. These findings were then confirmed in cellular experiments in the group of Haico van Attikum at Leiden University Medical Centre.

    "excerpt":"under construction   Academic Medical Center   The group of Strijkers at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam adopts a translational approach for the development of novel MRI sequences for improved diagnostics and therapy monitoring of disease. Novel preclinical protocols for high-field MRI are initially developed in ex vivo specimens as well as mouse and rat models. The most promising protocols are then further developed and translated for human clinical MRI. The group primarily but not exclusively focuses on applications in cardiovascular disease.   The availability of the 950MHz and 1.2 GHz NMR with micro-imaging capabilities offers unique opportunities to study the relationship between the MRI signal/contrast and the underlying (patho-)physiology of tissues from a fundamental perspective in much more detail than is possible at lower fields.   Leiden University Medical Center   At the Gorter initiative for magnetic resonance from man to molecule, groups from physics, chemistry and the medical faculty collaborate. The high field imaging group from the Leiden University Medical Center has recently been added to the uNMR consortium. This group, headed by Prof. Andrew Webb, brings a long expertise in high frequency RF coil design. Of specific interest for the uNMR-NL consortium are the expertise in micro-coils for NMR spectroscopy and MR microimaging as well as new coil designs using high permittivity ceramics rather than conventional metal based conductors. These latter designs have particular advantages at very high fields.   Radbound University Medical Center   The biomedical Magnetic Resonance group of Scheenen from the university medical center in Nijmegen has its focus on preclinical development, translation and application of MR imaging and spectroscopy in oncology and energy metabolism. The department’s animal MR-facility is housed in the PRIME (Preclinical Imaging Centre, an official Euro Bio-imaging node and an NWO technology hotel) of the Radboudumc. To bring the preclinical applications at the highest level we invest in the development and implementation of MR methods on a variety of advanced MR systems. A horizontal bore 7T MR system (Clinscan) and a horizontal bore 11.7T MR system (Biospec) are optimized for studies of small animals (e.g. mice and rats). A broad range of dedicated RF probes, from 1H microcoils for zebrafish to 31P coils for dynamic muscle studies of mice, and animal monitoring devices are available.   Utrecht Medical Center   The group of Prompers conducts research at the UMCU focusing on the study of derangements in tissue lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function, which play a central role in e.g. type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. To this end she develops multi-nuclear in vivo MRS methods for both pre-clinical and clinical applications at high field strength (7 Tesla and above). Recently, her group demonstrated the application of 1H and 31P MRS to measure in vivo the amount of triglycerides and the energy status, respectively, in the fast-beating mouse heart, which so far has only been accomplished by a couple of laboratories worldwide. In addition to the clinical and pre-clinical work, the group makes use of model systems for human disease, such as zebrafish and organoids. The micro-imaging capabilities of the uNMR-NL 950 MHz and 1.2 GHz MR system offer unprecedented sensitivity and resolution for these small model systems and will allow major advancements, for example in the field of regenerative cardiovascular medicine.

    "excerpt":"Take a tour of these exciting featured uNMR-NL projects   Research areas within uNMR-NL   The development of molecular sciences for materials, food and health critically depends on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.   The versatility of Magnetic Resonance to characterize equally well all kinds of materials, biomolecules, processes and living organisms makes NMR an indispensable tool to find solutions for major problems that our society faces.   As a non-invasive method, modern NMR represents one out of very few widely applied analytical methods that grows with the development of sciences and has continuously found new and abundant application in virtually all research fields in biology, chemistry, physics and medicine.   Technology development  Development of sophisticated probes and pulse sequences, hyphenation with other techniques and dedicated sample preparation methods.   Life-sciences  Atomic detailed information on biomolecular structures and their complexes to understand biomolecular (mal)functioning in cells.   Health  Development of high-field MRI as a non-invasive diagnostic tool. Characterisation and molecular interaction of novel drugs or drug delivery systems.   Nutrition  Microstructure characterization of foods to optimize industrial processing and enhance quality concerning health and texture. Quantitative metabolic profiling of body fluids to study dietary effects.   Chemistry &amp; Materials  Functional characterisation of materials, such as efficient catalysts or high-performance plastics. Monitoring and characterisation of chemical reactions and their mechanism.   New energy  Unraveling the molecular basics of energy regulation and storage in intact plants and algae and characterisation of novel materials for the generation and storage of energy.   uNMR Video  This video produced to celebrate the opening of the uNMR-NL facility nicely illustrates the wide field of applications for NMR.

    "excerpt":"## Netherlands' Magnetic Resonance School  The Netherlands’ magnetic resonance graduate school (NMARRS) is a joint educational and research initiative of four major centres for magnetic resonance research (RU, UU, UL, WU) forming one unified consortium. The school is crafted around the ultra-high field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility for the Netherlands (uNMR-NL) which is one of the best equipped NMR facilities in the world. NMR spectroscopy is one of the most information-rich spectroscopic methods and has widespread application in fundamental and applied research in chemistry, biology, medicine, materials and food sciences.  The Netherlands’ magnetic resonance graduate school (NMARRS) is a joint educational and research initiative of four major centres for magnetic resonance research (RU, UU, UL, WU) forming one unified consortium. The school is crafted around the ultra-high field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance facility for the Netherlands (uNMR-NL) which is one of the best equipped NMR facilities in the world. NMR spectroscopy is one of the most information-rich spectroscopic methods and has widespread application in fundamental and applied research in chemistry, biology, medicine, materials and food sciences.  The versatility of NMR derives from both the sensitivity of the nuclear spin toward its local environment, as well as the ability of the experimenter to manipulate nuclear angular momentum in elaborate ways to obtain optimal spectroscopy and imaging. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and Imaging (MRI) exploit these magnetic properties of atoms. NMR is applied to understand the causes of disease and to discover new medicines, to develop new battery and solar cell materials and to improve crop production and food quality.  The Netherlands has always been one of the leading countries in the field of NMR technology, with several excellent NMR research groups throughout the country. Maintaining this position requires access to the most advanced technology combined with a continuous training of new generations of magnetic resonance experts that can drive the development of the field forward. Therefore, NMARRS offers advanced magnetic resonance education by experts in the field and a chance to define one’s own research project; Students who enter will follow various magnetic resonance courses in their MSc programme and write and submit a PhD proposal, supported by their chosen supervisor for evaluation by the NMARRS board. The best proposals will be granted a PhD position.  [Learn More](http://www.ru.nl/science/solidstatenmr/nmarrs/training-education/)","url": "http://localhost:4000/education/nmarrs/"
