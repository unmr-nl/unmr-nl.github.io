3. Project description

	*Short description of the work to be carried out*
 
4. Sample characteristics, e.g.:

	⋅ Sample name and molecular weight (number of residues)

	⋅ Solution / solid / micro-imaging

	⋅ Sample additives

	⋅ Solution: Solubility/solvent/concentration

	⋅ Aggregation state at NMR conditions

	⋅ pH requirements
