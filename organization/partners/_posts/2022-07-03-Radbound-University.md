## [Radbound University](https://www.ru.nl/science/magneticresonance/)

The Nijmegen solid-state NMR group (Kentgens, van Eck, Tessari) combines the study of materials with NMR methodology and technology developments ranging from groundbreaking microfluidic probe technology and liquid-state DNP concepts, pulsed methods to study quadrupolar nuclei, to solid-state micro MAS technology. The materials under investigation are all placed in a societally relevant context, such as materials for the generation and storage of energy, solar cell materials, efficient catalysts, pharmaceuticals and drug-delivery systemsand polymeric materials from engineering plastics to high performance plastics.
