## [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/nmr)


The NMR group at Utrecht University focuses on high-resolution solid-state (Baldus, Weingarth) and liquid-state NMR (van Ingen), as well as on computational studies of biomolecules and their interactions (Bonvin). The research aims at gaining fundamental insight into biological processes using NMR in combination with molecular biology and computational structural biology methods.

Novel research concepts are being developed and applied to complex biomolecular systems in the context of diseases such as cancer or Alzheimerâ€™s disease and for the development of novel antibiotics or biomaterials including drug carriers or artificial tissues.
