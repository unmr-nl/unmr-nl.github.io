## University of Groningen

The van der Wel group specializes in state-of-the-art solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which is used to probe the structure and dynamics of nano-sized assemblies. One biophysical focus of the research is studying the molecular causes of neurodegenerative diseases, and the role of protein misfolding, protein deposition, and mitochondrial protein-lipid interactions therein. At the same time the group uses similar methods to understand the structure-function relationships behind other non-biological assemblies. 

## Academic Medical Center

The group of Strijkers at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam adopts a translational approach for the development of novel MRI sequences for improved diagnostics and therapy monitoring of disease. Novel preclinical protocols for high-field MRI are initially developed in ex vivo specimens as well as mouse and rat models. The most promising protocols are then further developed and translated for human clinical MRI. The group primarily but not exclusively focuses on applications in cardiovascular disease.

The availability of the 950 MHz and 1.2 GHz NMR with micro-imaging capabilities offers unique opportunities to study the relationship between the MRI signal/contrast and the underlying (patho-)physiology of tissues from a fundamental perspective in much more detail than is possible at lower fields.

## Leiden University Medical Center 

At the Gorter initiative for magnetic resonance from man to molecule, groups from physics, chemistry and the medical faculty collaborate. The high field imaging group from the Leiden University Medical Center has recently been added to the uNMR consortium. This group, headed by Prof. Andrew Webb, brings a long expertise in high frequency RF coil design. Of specific interest for the uNMR-NL consortium are the expertise in micro-coils for NMR spectroscopy and MR microimaging as well as new coil designs using high permittivity ceramics rather than conventional metal based conductors. These latter designs have particular advantages at very high fields.

## Radbound University Medical Center 

The biomedical Magnetic Resonance group of Scheenen from the university medical center in Nijmegen has its focus on preclinical development, translation and application of MR imaging and spectroscopy in oncology and energy metabolism. The department’s animal MR-facility is housed in the PRIME (Preclinical Imaging Centre, an official Euro Bio-imaging node and an NWO technology hotel) of the Radboudumc. To bring the preclinical applications at the highest level we invest in the development and implementation of MR methods on a variety of advanced MR systems. A horizontal bore 7T MR system (Clinscan) and a horizontal bore 11.7T MR system (Biospec) are optimized for studies of small animals (e.g. mice and rats). A broad range of dedicated RF probes, from <sup>1</sup>H microcoils for zebrafish to <sup>31</sup>P coils for dynamic muscle studies of mice, and animal monitoring devices are available.

## Utrecht Medical Center

At the Image Sciences Institute, Division of Imaging & Oncology at UMC Utrecht, the Tax group aims to establish a translational framework that connects MRI studies on humans with investigations involving organoids. Since the installation of the 1.2 GHz (28.2 T) NMR spectrometer, equipped with high-resolution MRI capabilities, they have leveraged this system to achieve remarkable results in exploring novel approaches to studying organoids using MRS and diffusion MRI. Their goal is to develop a validation framework for histological tissue estimates from diffusion MRI using the 28.2 T system, enabling unprecedented high resolutions. Additionally, they collaborate with the Princess Máxima Center to translate these results to imaging pediatric brain tumors.
