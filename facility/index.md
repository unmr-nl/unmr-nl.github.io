## Ultrahigh-field NMR for the Netherlands
<img src="/assets/images/logos/logo_nwo.png" align="left" />
Supported by the Dutch Research Council (<a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/about-nwo">NWO</a>), uNMR-NL enables non-invasive characterization of molecular systems from the atomic to micrometer range by ultra-high field NMR.  It is a <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/national-roadmap-large-scale-research-facilities">national large scale facility</a>) (GWI) and connects all Dutch high-field NMR centers.


## Equipment and expertise

We offer expertise and measurement time on spectrometers currently ranging from 600 to 1200 MHz for solid- and liquid-state NMR as well as micro-imaging. The current uNMR-NL high-end 1.2 GHz spectrometer is equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation for all three fields of research, providing the highest sensitivity and resolution in the Netherlands. Moreover, dedicated NMR instrumentation and expertise is available at the four uNMR-NL sites.

**High-field NMR spectrometers**:\
the uNMR-NL facility provides the highest field (1.2 GHz) in the Netherlands

**High-sensitive liquid-state NMR**:\
cryoprobes on several high-field NMR magnets (600, 800, 850, 950, 1200 MHz) for high-senstive liquid-state NMR

**ssNMR with DNP**:\
solid-state NMR using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) at different fields (400, 600, 800 MHz)

**High-field microimaging**:\
micro-imaging probes with several inserts (bird-cage, solenoid and planar coils) at different fields (600, 750, 950, 1200 MHz)

**Paramagnetic tags**:\
support for the design and synthesis of paramagnetic probes for protein research

**Small volume NMR**:\
development of small volume probes for NMR on volume limited samples or to follow chemical reactions
