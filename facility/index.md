## Ultrahigh-field NMR for the Netherlands

The uNMR-NL facility enables non-invasive characterization of molecular systems from the atomic to micrometer range by ultra-high field NMR. We offer expertise and measurement time on spectrometers currently ranging from 600-950 MHz for solid- and liquid-state NMR as well as micro-imaging. The current uNMR-NL high-end 1.2 GHz spectrometer is equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation for all three fields of research, providing the highest sensitivity and resolution in the Netherlands. Moreover, dedicated NMR instrumentation and expertise is available at the four uNMR-NL sites.

## We offer equipment and expertise

**High-sensitive liquid-state NMR**:\
cryprobes on several high-field NMR magnets (600, 800, 850, 950, 1200 MHz) for high-senstive liquid-state NMR

**NMR on light-sensitive samples**:\
laser equipment and dedicated solid- & liquid-state probes for NMR experiments on light-sensitive molecules or materials

**ssNMR with DNP**:\
solid-state NMR using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) at different fields (400, 600, 800 MHz)

**High-field microimaging**:\
micro-imaging probes with several inserts (bird-cage, solenoid and planar coils) at different fields (600, 750, 950, 1200 MHz)

**Paramagnetic tags**:\
support for the design and synthesis of paramagnetic probes for protein research

**Small volume NMR**:\
