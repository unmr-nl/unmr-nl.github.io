Researchers led by [Anjali Pandit](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/anjali-pandit) at Leiden University have demonstrated a pioneering approach that uses solid-state NMR spectroscopy to observe live-cell metabolic changes in real time. By applying advanced NMR pulse techniques to intact photosynthetic microalgae, Pandit’s team successfully tracked fermentation processes and lipid metabolism, revealing how cells adapt when deprived of light and oxygen inside the magnet. This breakthrough provides new insights into biological resilience, showing detailed metabolic adjustments and structural changes at the molecular level. The findings highlight Pandit’s leadership in using NMR to follow dynamic events in living systems, opening new horizons for studying cellular processes and bioproduct recovery in real time.
