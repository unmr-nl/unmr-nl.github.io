Leiden University is part of the SUNER-C consortium awarded a €4 million EU grant to advance the development of climate-neutral fuels through artificial photosynthesis. The multi-partner project aims to create sustainable alternatives by efficiently converting water and CO<sub>2</sub> into fuels like methanol using sunlight, mimicking natural plant processes. Coordinated by Utrecht University, the consortium brings together academia, industry, and NGOs to accelerate green energy innovations crucial for achieving CO<sub>2</sub> neutrality by 2065. Leiden University focuses on fundamental research to enhance artificial photosynthesis efficiency, contributing to the urgent global energy transition.
