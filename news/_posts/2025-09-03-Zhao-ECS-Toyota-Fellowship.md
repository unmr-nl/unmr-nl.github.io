[Dr. Zhao](https://www.ru.nl/en/people/zhao-w) is a tenured Assistant Professor at the Institute for Molecules and Materials (IMM) at Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen. His core research focuses on developing operando/in situ NMR methods for studying electrochemical storage and conversion chemistries, including redox flow batteries, electrochemical ammonia synthesis, carbon dioxide reduction, and lignin oxidation.
Evan Wenbo Zhao has been selected as one of the recipients of the 2025-2026 ECS Toyota Young Investigator Fellowships, recognizing his innovative contributions to green energy technology research.
The fellowship program represents a strategic partnership between The Electrochemical Society (ECS) and the Toyota Research Institute of North America (TRINA), a division of Toyota Motor North America R&D. This collaboration aims to advance cutting-edge electrochemical research that could transform the clean energy landscape.
The competitive fellowship program supports young professionals and scholars pursuing breakthrough research in battery and fuel cell technologies. Recipients are selected based on their potential to develop innovative and unconventional approaches to green energy solutions through electrochemical research.
“This fellowship underscores our commitment to fostering the next generation of researchers who will drive the future of sustainable energy,” said a program spokesperson. The initiative reflects both organizations’ dedication to accelerating the development of clean energy technologies that could play a crucial role in addressing global climate challenges.
Zhao joins a select group of emerging researchers whose work is expected to contribute significantly to advances in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies. The fellowship provides support for innovative projects that push the boundaries of conventional approaches to green energy research.
The partnership between ECS and Toyota continues to strengthen the pipeline of young talent entering the critical fields of battery and fuel cell development, supporting the broader transition to sustainable energy systems.
