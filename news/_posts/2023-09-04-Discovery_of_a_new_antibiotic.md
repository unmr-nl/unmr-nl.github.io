Researchers at Utrecht University lead by Markus Weingarth (https://www.weingarth-group.org/) and collaborators from Bonn University (Germany), the German Center for Infection Research (DZIF), Northeastern University of Boston (USA), and the company NovoBiotic Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, USA) discovered a new powerful antibiotic, isolated from bacteria that could not be studied before, that seems to be capable of combating harmful bacteria and even multi-resistant ‘superbugs’. Named Clovibactin, the antibiotic appears to kill bacteria in an unusual manner, making it more difficult for bacteria to develop any resistance against it. The discovery of Clovibactin and its killing mechanism was published in the scientific journal Cell.
