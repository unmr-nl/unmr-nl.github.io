Professor [Marcellus Ubbink](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/marcellus-ubbink) of Leiden University has received an NWO M-grant to investigate the properties of ancient proteins reconstructed from amino acid sequences dating back hundreds of millions of years. The project aims to perform laboratory evolution on these ancestral proteins, assessing how their activity and stability change as they evolve toward their modern descendants. Insights gained from this research will contribute to the design of innovative enzymes for human applications, supporting breakthroughs in biotechnology and medicine.
