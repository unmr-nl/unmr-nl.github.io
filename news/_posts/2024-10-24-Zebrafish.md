Researchers at Leiden University have presented the first MRI study of the zebrafish brain using an ultra-high magnetic field strength of 28.2 T. This study reveals remarkable microstructural details in the adult zebrafish brain. Additionally, ultra-high field DTI with multi-shell multi-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution enabled the non-invasive identification of white matter structures with exceptional resolution and contrast. These findings demonstrate that ultra-high field DTI and tractography at 28.2T can generate reproducible and quantitative maps of fiber organization in the tiny zebrafish brain, offering promising potential for studying disease-related microstructural changes in zebrafish models of various brain disorders.
