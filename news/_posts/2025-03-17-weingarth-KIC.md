A consortium led by [Markus Weingarth](https://www.weingarth-group.net) at Utrecht University has received €1.5 million from the Dutch Research Council (NWO) to tackle the complex problem of antibiotic toxicity, with a special focus on reducing drug-induced kidney damage. The project, supported by both academic and industry partners, aims to uncover the molecular rules behind toxic side effects in promising antibiotics such as teixobactin. If successful, the research could revolutionize drug development by enabling scientists to predict and prevent toxicity earlier in the process, saving millions in costs and improving drug safety worldwide. The team will also investigate cilastatin as a strategy to inhibit kidney damage, bringing new hope for safer therapies amid growing antibiotic resistance.
